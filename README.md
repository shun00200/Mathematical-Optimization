# Mathematical Optimization

This repository is dedicated to providing solutions and examples for various mathematical optimization problems. It includes different methods and approaches to tackle these problems efficiently.

## Linear Programming

Currently, the repository contains a dedicated folder named `linear_programming` where algorithms and solutions related to linear programming problems are stored. This folder includes scripts, data files, and documentation to help understand and solve linear programming problems using different algorithms.

The `linear_programming` folder is structured to provide a clear and comprehensive guide to linear programming, including theoretical explanations, practical examples, and code implementations.

## Future Additions

While the repository currently focuses on linear programming, I plan to expand it to include other mathematical optimization methods. Future additions will cover a wide range of topics such as:

- Integer Programming
- Stochastic Programming

Each new method will be added in its respective folder within the repository, similar to the `linear_programming` folder.I aim to provide a comprehensive resource for mathematical optimization techniques, catering to both beginners and advanced users.
